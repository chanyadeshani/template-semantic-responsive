<h2>Healthier Families</h2>
  <p>Healthier Families is a service for understanding why it is so important to keep you and your family healthy in many different ways. From dieting to a range of activities to keep you and your little ones active. Simple food swap ideas can help cut down on the bad habits such as sugar, salt and fat in your family's diet. Even just 1 or 2 everyday swaps can really make a huge difference and go a long way to making each day healthier</p>
  <p>For example, when lunchtime rolls around, it's easy to eat more sugar or salt than we all realise. Try swapping things like yoghurts and pudding pots to lower sugar fromage frails or plain natural yoghurt. Or even muffins and chocloate to a slice of malt loaf or a fruited tea cake. Use the free NHS Food Scanner app to find out what's really in the food you're buying and get swap suggestions while you're at the shelf. Picking products that have they 'good choice' badge on the packaging is a quick and easy way to decide what to buy </p>
  <p>Another way to keep healthy is by keeping active. Healthier Families offer an incredible list of different activites to keep your little ones interested. One example of an indoor activity is just dance. The amazing thing about this is that you don't need any special kit or even much space. Find a live performance or music video and try to copy the dance routine. You could aslo have a competition to see who can come up with the best new dance moves. </p>
